# node-js-async-workflow

Made this scheme for myself during studying how does Actually async works in js.

Left is what happens to function when typing async keyword.

Right is just async workflow along with event loop.

Not sure if this thing is clear enough (it's not ðŸ™ƒ), but helped me a lot at the time, so kept it and look sometimes.

*Got Async function example from ![here](https://ponyfoo.com/articles/understanding-javascript-async-await#further-reading)
